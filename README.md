## CONSUMit

###Problem:

While global leaders struggle to figure out how to nourish 9 billion people, a challenge anytime but especially in a warming world, nearly 40% of the food is wasted – spoiled before anyone can eat it. Every year, the average person produces nearly 475 pounds of food waste. That adds up to a whopping 70+ million tons, making it the third largest component by weight in our landfills. And with today’s busy schedules, people tend to forget what food products they have stocked back at home. Leaders are dealing with this issue in various ways  like promoting left-over food management. But we aim to target this issue at the root level by avoiding the waste itself.

###Solution:

Since charity begins at home, we aim to reduce the food wastage by helping the family members in being cognizant of the food stocked at their place. We aim to develop an app that will 
keep track the food items bought, tracking their expiry dates and reminding the family members, through notifications, about the food stock they should consume within time to avoid wastage. 

###Future Enhancements:

Suppose our app notifies a family that tomatoes would be perished in next 2 days. If family know they won’t be cooking for next 2 days then they can notify NGO. This is more common with the working people as with their busy schedules, they tend to forget what food products they have stocked. In future enhancement, we want to integrate NGO available in that area with the app to get food donation reaching nearest destination.

##Curb Inspector 

###Problem:

Currently, in U.S., free curbside parking is available, in many places, for a limited amount of time. There are officers appointed to check that no one exceeds the time limit set. For that, they mark the tires with a particular color and take rounds of the streets to check if someone has still parked their vehicle there and exceeded the time limit. In this case, lot of manpower is wasted which can be put to good use elsewhere.

###Solution:

To solve this issue, we propose a system that will automate most of this process reducing the overall expenses. We propose to deploy sensors on the designated curbs which will track the duration for which the vehicles are parked. If they exceed the time limit, a notification will be sent to the officer nearby with the location of the vehicle and then the officer can take action further.

###User Stories:

####User Story 1
As a policer officer, I want to track the vehicles that exceed the time allotted so that I can carry out further process without monitoring the vehicles continuously
####User Story 2
As the mayor of the city, I want to reduce the manpower allocated for monitoring vehicles so that I can reduce the cost and reutilize the manpower in making the city secure.
